# kubernetes-webhook-example

This is a [Kubernetes admission webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) example modified from [slackhq repo](https://github.com/slackhq/simple-kubernetes-webhook). It is meant to be used as a validating and mutating admission webhook as the template for kubebuilder.

## Environment
This project run kubernetes webhook on cluster of google Kubernetes engine 

* kubectl = 1.23
* make = 4.2.1
* Go =1.18
* google kubernetes engine = 1.21

### Deploy Admission Webhook

* To configure the cluster to use the admission webhook and to deploy said webhook, simply run:
```
‚ùØ make deploy
```

* Then, make sure the admission webhook pod is running (`NAMESPACE` can be set in `Makefile`):
```
‚ùØ kubectl get pods -n NAMESPACE
```

* You can stream logs from it:
```
‚ùØ make logs

üîç Streaming simple-kubernetes-webhook logs...
kubectl logs -l app=simple-kubernetes-webhook -n "simple-webhook" -f
time="2022-04-17T10:41:42Z" level=info msg="Listening on port 443..."
time="2022-04-17T11:01:46Z" level=debug msg=healthy uri=/health
time="2022-04-17T11:01:49Z" level=debug msg=healthy uri=/health
```

* And hit it's health endpoint from local machine:
```
‚ùØ make port-forward-test.
```

Open another terminal, and type:
```
‚ùØ curl -k https://localhost:8443/health
OK
```

### Deploying pods
Deploy a valid test pod that gets succesfully created:
```
‚ùØ make pod

üöÄ Deploying test pod...
kubectl apply -f dev/manifests/pods/lifespan-seven.pod.yaml
pod/lifespan-seven created
```
You should see in the admission webhook logs that the pod got mutated and validated.

Deploy a non valid pod that gets rejected:
```
‚ùØ make bad-pod

üöÄ Deploying "bad" pod...
kubectl apply -f dev/manifests/pods/bad-name.pod.yaml
Error from server: error when creating "dev/manifests/pods/bad-name.pod.yaml": admission webhook "simple-kubernetes-webhook.acme.com" denied the request: pod name contains "offensive"
```
You should see in the admission webhook logs that the pod validation failed. It's possible you will also see that the pod was mutated, as webhook configurations are not ordered.
